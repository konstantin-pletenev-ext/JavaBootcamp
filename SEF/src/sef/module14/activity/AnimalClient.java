	//Make sure to use Generics
	//so that it only allows Animal objects to be added to the list

	
	//2 - Add 4 Dog objects to the list. One example given below
	//list.add(new Dog("Brown", 4,"Pomeranian"));
	
	//3 - Add 2 Cat objects
	
	//4 - Create 2 variables to keep a count of Dog and Cat Objects added to the list  
	
	//5 - Create an enhanced for loop to traverse trough the list
		
	//6 - Count and print how many Dog and Cat objects are present in the list.
	//You can use instanceof to check which class does an object belong to
